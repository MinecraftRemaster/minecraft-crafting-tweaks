# Better Dyeables - CO edition

That is better and modified version of Better Dyeables.

### Main Idea

A quintessentially different datapack. Such as "Universal Dyeing", "Better Dyeables" etc., as well as my ideas on the subject.

### Changes

- Added beds, concrete powder, glazed terracotta dyeing.
- Added dyeing and undyeing already dyed blocks.
- Added missed features.
- Added not-same color policy.
- Resorted and reordered.
- **I made almost full generator of such datapack!**

### TODO

- Disable default dyeing crafting recipes.

### Original

Added some modified files from Vanilla Tweaks.

**But since I have my own script generator, I no longer have to worry about copyright.**
