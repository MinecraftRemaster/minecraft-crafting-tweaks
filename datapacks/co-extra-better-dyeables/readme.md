# Better Dyeables - CO edition

That is better and modified version of Better Dyeables.

### Main Idea

A quintessentially different datapack. Such as "Universal Dyeing", "Better Dyeables" etc., as well as my ideas on the subject.

### Changes

- Added beds, concrete powder, glazed terracotta dyeing.
- Added dyeing and undyeing already dyed blocks.
- Added missed features.
- Resorted and reordered.

### Reserved

- Not color tags (will used in future).

### Original
